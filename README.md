# Left 4 Dead 1/2 Nextbots
This addon is currently under heavy development, any PR's and contributions is highly appreciated. 
We attempt to fully recreate everything about the game's nextbots, while we want the finest details and everything, not everything will be 100% accurate.

# What's planned?
We plan on making Common Infected nextbots, special infected and SurvivorBots.

# FAQ
### Q: Can you add x infected mod from the L4D2 workshop?

### A: We first need to get permission from the original uploader, if they decides to give us permission, we will add x model, but for now, we are only working with Cuba's Common Infected and base L4D2 models (including TLS models).

### Q: Can you more variations like the Human Infected Skin?

### A: We don't really want to bloat up the files, as textures (currently) is 400MB for both L4D1 and L4D2 models, and Cuba's Common Infected have different UV texture placement for different skin colors based on the heads. I can also see some people perfer Grey/Human skin tones over the green skin tone that Cuba has done, which is fair. We'll see in the future for more possible L4D1 skin variations like Human looking skin and grey skin.
